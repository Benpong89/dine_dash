jBerry is a library that can be used for manipulating, traversing and event handling in the DOM. While the functions of jBerry can accomplished with vanilla Javascript, utilizing jBerry allows for DRY and shorter code.

Include the following script inside of your HTML document.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./lib/jberry.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

The core function of jBerry is `$b(arg)`. This function utilizes vanilla DOM function `querySelectorAll()` to select and return a Nodelist of HTML elements that match the arg. Once we have the Nodelist, we convert the Nodelist into an array and pass it in as a new instance of a DOMNodeCollection. jBerry methods are defined inside of this class.

#### jBerry methods include:
